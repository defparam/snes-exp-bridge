# snes-exp-bridge
This project is intended to create a bridge board interface to the SNES expansion port broken out to DB-25 and 3.5mm barrel audio. The expansion port requires a costly proprietary connector from SAMTEC (MEC2-30-01-L-DV). The idea is instead of creating projects which source this connector, all downstream projects can now instead mate with the DB-25 connector which is cheaper and easier for interfacing. There are no active electrical components for this board. This repo contains altium design files of the schematic/layout, photos and pdf docs.

Enjoy!
